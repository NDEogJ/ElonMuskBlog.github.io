        Like I said at National Governors Association, "The thing that drives me is that I want to be able to think about the future and feel good about that," "that's what really drives me — trying to figure out how to make sure that things are great and going to be so." I just want the future to be the one we dream of.

        Why do buy/make the companys that I do? The short answer, I am trying to make the future the one we dream of. Long answer, I dont want to sit on an island all my life, I would have to be on serious drugs for that. Instead I like helping the world acoplish the future we dream of. I want to be part of it and not just watch it happen.

        I am remembering how I was bullied in school. It was horible, I was lonely and my only friends betrayed me. One gang would follow me for years untill I moved. I had good grades and read a lot of books but that didn't change the fact that I was the go to bully kid.
